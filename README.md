## TABLE OF CONTENTS

## OVERVIEW

This project is designed to enable a fictive restaurant to manage table bookings easily. The users are given the ability to create a booking, write a review or to delete their user accounts or their reviews all together. <u>Staff members are given the possibility to review and cancel bookings after the client has contacted the restaurant for a cancellation.</u> <u>This is a business decision so users dont juggle around with booked tables without the restaurant oner knowing.</u> The site was developed using Django, HTML. CSS and JavaScript.

## AGILE METHODOLOGY

The use of agile tools can be seen [in the project tab](https://github.com/users/RebellionWebdesign/projects/5) 

## FEATURES

### EXISTING FEATURES

- Register to the website using email and password
- Log in to the website using email and password
- Users can create a profile, edit the data and delete the profile
- Users can create reviews, edit the reviews and delete the reviews
- Users can create bookings, but not delete or edit them. This is a business decision (see overview for details)
- Admin can do all of the above
- One feature that did not make it is the separate staff area. However, this is considered a can have feature because the functionality is there in the admin panel under "Bokings". The app and its model are still in the code to fulfill feature completeness in the future.

### FUTURE FEATURE CONSIDERATIONS

- Finish the staff area page
- Add a menu app so the user can directly order a meal upon booking and see what is on the card
- Refine the booking number calculation
