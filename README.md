## TABLE OF CONTENTS

## OVERVIEW

This project is designed to enable a fictive restaurant to manage table bookings easily. The users are given the ability to create a booking, write a review or to delete their user accounts or their reviews all together. <u>Staff members are given the possibility to review and cancel bookings after the client has contacted the restaurant for a cancellation.</u> <u>This is a business decision so users dont juggle around with booked tables without the restaurant oner knowing.</u> The site was developed using Django, HTML.
